# [Systems Shell Programming](/systems-shell-programming/)

This assignment involves developing a simple shell program in C that supports basic commands, emulating a command-line interface. The program should run in an endless loop, executing user input commands until the `quit` command is issued. The shell should be designed to work on Linux using Cygwin.

# [Remote Execution Game](/remote-execution-game/)

Develop a simple remote execution system comprising two programs:  
- **Game Server**: Manages the game and communicates with clients.  
- **Game Client**: Used by players to communicate with the server.  

The game, called **"Numbers"**, involves multi-player interactions through a network using a predefined protocol.

# [HPC Multithreading](/hpc-multithreading/)

Develop a distributed scientific computation service using a multi-threaded client-server system for high-performance computing (HPC). The server handles intensive mathematical operations on 32-bit integers and can process up to 12 concurrent requests using inter-process communication (IPC) and synchronisation techniques.
